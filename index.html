                <p class="popup__txt frst_lvl_p" >Personal data is data about your person. This includes your name, address and email address. You do not have to disclose any personal data in order to be able to visit our Internet site. In some cases, we need your name and address as well as further information in order to be able to offer you the requested service.</p>    

                <p class="popup__txt frst_lvl_p" >The same applies if we supply you with information material on request or if we answer your enquiries. In these cases, we will always point this out to you. Furthermore, we store only the data that you have sent to us either automatically or voluntarily.</p>    
                <p class="popup__txt frst_lvl_p" >If you use one of our services, we generally only collect the data that is necessary for us to be able to provide you with our service. We may ask you for further information, although this is only on a voluntary basis. Whenever we process personal data, we do so in order to be able to provide you with our service or to pursue our commercial objectives.</p>    
                <h3 class="popup__h3 black-text">Server log files</h3>  
                <p class="popup__txt frst_lvl_p" >The website provider automatically collects and stores information in so-called “server log files”, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>    
                
                - Date and time of the request
                - Name of the requested file
                - Page from which the file was requested
                - Access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)
                - Web browser and operating system used
                - Complete IP address of the requesting computer
                - Transferred data volume
                
                This data is not combined with other data sources. Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 (f) GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website.
                
                This data is temporarily stored by us for reasons of technical security, in particular in order to prevent attempts to attack our web server. It is not possible for us to draw conclusions about specific individuals on the basis of this data. After seven days at the latest, the data is made anonymous by shortening the IP address at the domain level, so that it is no longer possible to establish a reference to the individual user. The data is also processed in anonymous form for statistical purposes; it is not compared with other data stocks or passed on to third parties, even in the form of extracts. Only within the context of our server statistics, which we publish every two years in our activity report, is the number of page views made known.

The legal basis for the use of cookies is the legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
