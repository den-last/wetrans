                <p class="popup__txt frst_lvl_p" >The website provider automatically collects and stores information in so-called “server log files”, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>    
                
                - Date and time of the request
                - Name of the requested file
                - Page from which the file was requested
                - Access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)
                - Web browser and operating system used
                - Complete IP address of the requesting computer
                - Transferred data volume
                
                This data is not combined with other data sources. Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 (f) GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website.
                
                This data is temporarily stored by us for reasons of technical security, in particular in order to prevent attempts to attack our web server. It is not possible for us to draw conclusions about specific individuals on the basis of this data. After seven days at the latest, the data is made anonymous by shortening the IP address at the domain level, so that it is no longer possible to establish a reference to the individual user. The data is also processed in anonymous form for statistical purposes; it is not compared with other data stocks or passed on to third parties, even in the form of extracts. Only within the context of our server statistics, which we publish every two years in our activity report, is the number of page views made known.
